# DQTools
Tools for working with the DataCube. Includes reading metadata, registering new products and writing new data to the Datacube.

There are two branches:

**'release'** contains the latest tested code which works with the 
released 
DataCube code used on the publicly available server. It will have 
tagged releases 
and users are strongly advised to download and use the latest release.
  
**'devel'** contains development code not suitable for use with the publicly available DataCube server.
