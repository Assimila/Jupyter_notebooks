Peatlands Demonstrator: TODO List 
Ross Carmichael, 6/8/21
==================================

1. [Fixed]

2.  NetCDF save fails for 'Identifying Change'and 'Trend Analysis : timeseries' modes.
    For operations where a signle number is output unsure if save method required.

3. 'Save Map' feature raises error as this method comes from a newer
    version of ipyleaflet.

4. [Fixed]

5. [Fixed]

6. Gerardo has a method to overlay data on the map which needs implemented 
   as ipyleaflet 'ImageOverlay()' doesn't seem to support local paths.

7. When a user enters manual coordinates into the float boxes the resulting
   marker/rectangle isn't cleared with the DrawControl() class. Same 
   applies to when a shapefile location is displayed.

8. When a user enters manual coordinates into the float boxes, previous layers
   drawn on the map are not yet cleared.

9. Overall styling and positioning of widgets/map/plot area could be 
   tweaked such that it looks more aesthetically pleasing.

10. Maybe possible to limit the boundaries of the map as if you move too
   far away from the UK all that is displayed is grey squares. Same 
   if zooming too far out.

11. OAuth2 could be used the handle the OS API key/secret key.

12. Add functionality to save rectangle layer as a .shp file.

13. Remove files saved to server once downloaded to client.
