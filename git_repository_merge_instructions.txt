The DQTools directory in this repository is NOT a copy but is a link to the
DQTools repository itself.

This has been achieved using the following commands:

Do this ONCE to get the repository into the container:
change to correct folder
    cd Jupyter_notebooks
list available branches
    git branch
change to correct branch
    git checkout devel
add the remote repository
    git remote add <name> <location>
    <name>=DQTools (but could be anything sensible)
    <location>=git@githubserver:/Assimila/DQTools.git
    this will add the master branch ready to merge
    NOTE: githubserver has been set up in ~/.ssh/config to be an alias for
    login and ssh key
pull the desired branch into git knowledge
    git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories <name>/<branch>
    <name>=DQTools
    <branch>=release
magic spell time... create the working copy
    git read-tree --prefix=<subdir> -u <name>/<branch>
    <subdir>=DQTools (but could be anything sensible)
    <name>=DQTools
    <branch>=release
now commit it all
    git commit -m "sub-tree added"

Do this when updating:
To get a specific branch or tag of the contained repository
    git pull -s subtree <subdir> <branch or tag>
    <subdir>=DQTools
    <branch or tag>=v2.0-beta-V_RC5 for example
You can then make a release of the parent repository as normal.

To get rid of the hosted repo:
git rm -r DQTools
